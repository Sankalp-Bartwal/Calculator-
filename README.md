# Calculator-
A python based scientific calculator. This is my first project.
The app uses the standard tkinter library and the standard math library. 
To use the app just download the file and run the command:
python3 calculator.py
The command is run in the terminal or the command line and the folder which contains the calculator.py should be open in terminal/command line.
